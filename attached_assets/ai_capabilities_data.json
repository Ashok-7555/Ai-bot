  {
    "input": "What is the Turing test?",
    "output": "The Turing Test, proposed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In the original format, a human evaluator engages in natural language conversations with both a human and a machine (without seeing either) and attempts to determine which is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. While initially influential in AI, many researchers now consider the Turing Test limited as a measure of intelligence, as it focuses on human deception rather than deeper aspects of intelligence like understanding, reasoning, and consciousness."
